### Stage P1: Time and resources required for Inchworm stage
### Only use at maximum, half the available CPUs on a node
# - Inchworm will not efficiently use any more than 4 CPUs and you will have to take longer for resources to be assigned
# —min_kmer_cov 2 to reduce memory requirements with large read sets.
WALLTIME_INCHWORM="4:00:00"             # optional on Wolfpack
MEMORY_INCHWORM="40"                    # will use it for --JM
NCPU_INCHWORM="4"                               # Use less than half of the CPUs on a node. This algorithm is limited by cache memory
NODES_INCHWORM="1"
NODETYPE_INCHWORM="all.q"
INPUT_INCHWORM="fastq"
#NODETYPE_INCHWORM="intel.q"    # Inchworm performs faster when Trinity was installed using the Intell compiler (Intell systems only

### Stage P2: Time and resources required for Chrysalis stage
### Starts with Bowtie alignment and post-processing of alignment file
### All CPUs presenct can be used for the Chrysalis parts.
#They may take a while to be provisioned, so the less request, possibly the faster the jobs turnaround.
# For one step (the parallel sort) it needs as much memory as specified in P1. Less memory, means more I/O for sorting
WALLTIME_CHRYSALIS="24:00:00"           # optional on Wolfpack
MEMORY_CHRYSALIS="40"                           # will use it for --JM
NCPU_CHRYSALIS="16"                             # For very large datasets, besides normalisation, maybe use 32 cores
NODES_CHRYSALIS="1"
NODETYPE_CHRYSALIS="all.q"              # dont use intel.q on Wolfpack for this
INPUT_CHRYSALIS="fastq"

# This stage is actually Chrysalis::readsToTranscript and Butterfly. Both should ideally be run through a SGE/PBS array
# The Chrysalis bit is I/O heavy, so a local memory node is used. If files take up over 500GB, this will cause problems.
# You may want to normalise your data and/or run Martin's optimised, standalone Trinity module
